# Firebase Realtime Database Intermittent Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered with Firebase Realtime Database where data updates are not consistently reflected in the UI using the `onValue` listener. The issue is intermittent, meaning it doesn't happen every time but frequently enough to be a significant problem. The data structure is simple, and there are no obvious errors in the console logs.  Solutions and debugging steps are included.

## Problem
The `onValue` listener registers and triggers as expected but fails to update the UI with the latest database changes in some cases. This occurs despite no visible errors.  The timing of the failure is inconsistent.
