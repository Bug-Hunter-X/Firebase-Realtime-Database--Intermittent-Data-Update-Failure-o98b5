In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't updating in real-time even though I was using the `onValue` listener correctly. The listener would trigger, but the changes made to the database through another client wouldn't reflect in the UI immediately or at all sometimes.  The data structure was a simple JSON object and there were no apparent errors in the console logs. The problem was intermittent; sometimes it worked as expected, but other times the updates would be delayed or completely fail to appear.
